## 🏥 Healthcare Compliance

- **HIPAA & NPHIES:** All software must comply with PHI/PII protection, audit logging, and role-based access controls.
- **FHIR R4:** All data models and APIs must conform to FHIR R4, HL7, and DICOM standards.
- **Audit Logging:** All access to sensitive data is logged and regularly reviewed.
- **Encryption:** All PHI/PII is encrypted at rest and in transit (AES-256/GCM, TLS 1.3+).

## 🔐 Security Practices

### 1. Access Control

- **Principle of Least Privilege:** Only grant minimum permissions necessary.
- **Role-Based Access:** All actions must validate user roles and permissions.
- **Key Management:** API tokens, encryption keys, and credentials must be stored in environment variables and rotated regularly.

### 2. Code Security

- **Code Reviews:** All pull requests require security-focused code review.
- **Dependency Management:** Use Dependabot or similar for dependency scanning. No insecure/abandoned dependencies allowed.
- **Static Analysis:** Use tools like SonarQube, Bandit (Python), SwiftLint, and ESLint for continuous code scanning.
- **Secrets Detection:** No credentials, API keys, or PHI/PII in source code. Use secret scanning tools.

### 3. Data Protection

- **End-to-End Encryption:** All PHI/PII is encrypted in storage and transit.
- **Data Minimization:** Collect and store only data necessary for business/clinical use.
- **Data Masking:** Mask PHI/PII in logs, UI, and error messages.

### 4. Audit Logging

- **Comprehensive Logging:** All access and actions on PHI/PII are logged.
- **Log Retention:** Logs are stored securely for at least 6 years.
- **Log Review:** Regular automated and manual reviews for suspicious activity.

### 5. Vulnerability Management

- **Regular Scans:** Run vulnerability scans (SAST/DAST) before releases.
- **Patch Management:** Apply security patches within 48 hours of disclosure.
- **Incident Response:** Follow documented IRP for breaches or suspected incidents.

## 🔒 Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL)

- **Training:** Contributors must complete annual secure coding and compliance training.
- **Testing:** All code must have unit, integration, and security tests (including FHIR logic, role validation, clinical workflows).
- **Accessibility:** All UI/UX must be WCAG 2.1 and RTL/LTR adaptive.
- **CI/CD:** All builds must run security checks before deploy.

---

## 🏷️ Compliance & Legal

- **HIPAA, NPHIES, GDPR (where applicable)**
- **Saudi Data Law:** All data residency and localization rules must be followed.
- **Breach Notification:** Any data breach must be reported according to legal/regulatory guidelines.
